## Abstract
Seasonality is a fundamental challenge for life on Earth and energy storage prior to colder and drier periods by fattening is a common strategy of animals for survival. Fattening should reflect a trade-off between an expected seasonal energy deficit and the costs of increased body mass, which are particularly important to flying endotherms. We applied a phylogenetic, multilevel meta-analysis to published data on body mass change (Δ*M*<sub>b</sub>), a proxy of fat storage, among bat populations over low productivity periods (winter in temperate regions and dry periods in the tropics) to examine its relationship with global variation in yearly average and seasonality of local climates. We found that Δ*M*<sub>b</sub> increased with decreasing mean annual surface temperature (MAST) but Δ*M*<sub>b</sub> also increased at higher MAST with higher seasonality of rainfall. Seasonal use of body energy reserves by bats is predicted to be widespread in warm, seasonal climates at low latitudes but is poorly studied compared to cold temperate regions. We also found that, in colder climates only, overwinter mass loss was less for females than males, as predicted by the 'thrifty females' hypothesis, and furthermore, that Δ*M*<sub>b</sub> has increased with year of study in warm climates, possibly linked to effects of global climate change on their energetics. Our quantitative synthesis describes the intrinsic and environmental factors determining the extent of seasonal reliance on stored body energy reserves among bat populations, and highlights the global importance of seasonal fattening for survival in this diverse and widespread mammal group.
